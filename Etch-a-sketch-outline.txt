OUTLINE

HTML: 

    Reset Button
    Div for boxes
        1 div for each smaller box
        Start w. 16 boxes (4x4)

CSS:

    Container Div
        'Blank' Div
        Hovered Div
    

JAVASCRIPT
    
    Boxes:
        On mouseover, change color of the box. [change to another CSS class]
        I think hover won't work because it will 'release' the color after the mouse leaves the box.

    Buttons:
        Reset
            Alert for a number (x)
                create new boxes in layout x*x
                    replace old boxes
                div = blank

To add multiple divs, I need to put the creation of the element inside of a loop --- see this link:

    clientHeight:

        returns the inner height of an element in pixels, including padding but not the horizontal scrollbar height, border, or margin

    offsetHeight:

        is a measurement which includes the element borders, the element vertical padding, the element horizontal scrollbar (if present, if rendered) and the element CSS height.

    scrollHeight:

        is a measurement of the height of an element's content including content not visible on the screen due to overflow
